# setcap runs here, in the same stage the binary finally ships in, rather
# than in an earlier stage whose result is then copied in with COPY
# --from=: a file capability's extended attribute (security.capability) is
# not part of a layer's portable file metadata the way owner/mode/mtime
# are, so a COPY --from= between build stages is not guaranteed to carry it
# over. This Dockerfile therefore never copies an already-capability-bearing
# file across a stage boundary; setcap always runs directly on the copy
# that ships in the final image. libcap is installed only long enough to
# run setcap once, then removed; removing the package does not touch the
# xattr it already wrote to this file.

# Effective bits are deliberately not set (+p, not +ep): an exec with an
# effective bit set fails outright (EPERM) if the process's bounding set is
# missing even one of the named capabilities, which would turn a `cap_add`
# typo in the Sensor's compose file into "the container refuses to start"
# instead of a self-check the observer reports in its evidence file. With
# +p only, whichever of these the bounding set actually grants become
# permitted-but-not-effective after exec; the observer raises them itself
# (sandbox.RaiseEffective) and reports any that did not make it.

# Pre-create the Sensor's default --evidence-dir, owned by the UID/GID the

# it is mounted over by a fresh, empty named volume (docker-compose.sensor.yml's
# own kestrelynx-runtime volume), Docker's own behavior of copying an image
# directory's existing content and ownership into a brand-new volume leaves
# that volume writable by the Sensor immediately — with no init container
# and no chown step anywhere in the Sensor's own compose file, which never
# runs as root at all (see that file's own user: 65532:65532). A volume that
# already has content (a second `docker compose up`, or one reused from a
# previous version) is never touched by this: Docker only copies the
# image's content into a target that is still completely empty at mount
# time.
