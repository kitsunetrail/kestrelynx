# Reading Process Information Without Root Using Linux Capabilities

Published: September 17, 2026

## Introduction

Linux exposes a running process's executable and mapped libraries through
`/proc`. Reading another user's process information, however, may require
additional permissions.

Linux capabilities let a collector run as a non-root user with selected
privileges. In an existing measurement, `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` allowed executable
and memory-map inspection, while listing file descriptors also required
`CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH`.[^measurements][^procfs-article]

This article covers the following:

- Linux capabilities relevant to reading process information.
- How ptrace access checks and file permissions interact.
- Measured results for four root and non-root permission conditions.
- The actual measurement collector and how it records its results.
- What to check when access still fails.

## What Linux capabilities are

Linux capabilities divide traditional root privileges by operation.
They are maintained per thread; permission checks use the effective
set.[^capabilities]

Two capabilities are particularly relevant here:

| Capability | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` | Authorizes ptrace operations and access to protected process information under `/proc` |
| `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` | Bypasses ordinary file-read and directory-read/search permission checks |

`CAP_SYS_PTRACE` also permits operations that modify another process's
memory. `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` is not limited to `/proc`.
Grant these capabilities only to programs needed for collection, and
restrict which users can execute those programs.[^capabilities]

## Why CAP_SYS_PTRACE is not enough to read everything

In the measurement, granting `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` to the non-root collector
allowed it to read `exe` and `maps`. Listing `fd/` still failed with a
permission error. Adding `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` allowed that operation to
succeed.[^procfs-article]

The difference comes from two separate checks: permission to access the
target process's information, and permission to access a directory.

### Permission to read exe and maps

The `exe` link identifies the executable, while `maps` describes memory
mappings, including loaded files. When these entries are read, Linux
checks whether the reader may access the target process's information.
This is the ptrace access check, where `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` is
relevant.[^exe][^maps][^ptrace]

In the measurement environment, granting `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` allowed the
collector to pass this check and identify executables and loaded
libraries.[^procfs-article]

Linux manuals call the read check used for `exe` and `maps`
`PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS`. Despite the name, this checks permission to
read information without attaching a debugger.[^ptrace]

### Permission to list fd/

The `fd/` directory contains links to a process's open files and sockets.
Inspecting them involves listing the directory first, then reading each
link.[^fd]

In the measurement, the target's `fd/` was owned by root with mode `0500`.
The non-root collector lacked permission to list it. `CAP_SYS_PTRACE`
did not bypass that restriction, so enumeration failed with `EACCES`
(permission denied).[^procfs-article][^fd-source]

Adding `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` bypassed the directory-permission restriction
and allowed enumeration. Reading the links afterward also involves a
ptrace access check, as with `exe`.[^capabilities][^fd]

| Measured operation | Capabilities needed in the measurement |
| --- | --- |
| Read `exe` and `maps` | `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` |
| List `fd/` and read its links | `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` and `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` |

With only `CAP_SYS_PTRACE`, the collector could therefore confirm package
use through loaded files, but could not use `fd/` to attribute listening
sockets to processes.[^procfs-article]

Similarly, reading a container file through `/proc/<pid>/root` requires
both access to process information and permissions on the files and
directories reached through that link.[^root] Required permissions depend
on the target; procfs mount settings and Linux Security Modules (LSMs),
such as AppArmor and SELinux, also impose restrictions.[^proc][^ptrace]

## Results for four permission conditions

The September 12, 2026 measurement compared four conditions for a collector
running directly on a Docker host. The main environment was WSL2 Linux
6.6.114 and Docker Engine 29.1.3, with no `hidepid` restriction. Non-root conditions used file capabilities on the
compiled executable.[^measurements][^procfs-article][^harness]

Yama was set to `ptrace_scope=1` during the measurement. This setting does
not directly restrict the `exe` and `maps` reads used here.[^yama-source]

| Collector condition | Package-use confirmation | Listener attribution | Main result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Root | Baseline | Available | Baseline collection succeeded |
| Non-root with `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` and `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` | Same as root | Same as root | Obtained the information compared in this measurement |
| Non-root with `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` | Same as root | Unavailable | Listing `fd/` was denied |
| Non-root without capabilities | Every sample failed observation | Unknown | Required process information could not be collected |

In this environment, `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` alone allowed reading `exe`, `maps`,
namespace links, and package metadata through `root`. Permissions inside
a container may require `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` for metadata access as
well.[^procfs-article]

Failure without capabilities does not mean that every procfs entry,
including `status`, was unreadable. The table describes whether collection
provided the information required to confirm package use.

A separate Ubuntu host with AppArmor enabled was tested only as root.
Non-root capability combinations were not verified there. These results
do not establish a universal minimum permission set for Linux
hosts.[^measurements]

## The program used for the measurement

The four permission conditions were measured with `runtime-discovery`, a
collector implemented in Go. The published sampling version (`ed7813e`)
is available in its [README](https://github.com/kitsunetrail/kestrelynx/blob/ed7813edc159f5ea0b6a747bfebf78e45fa2ba23/experiments/runtime-discovery/README.md) and
[source code](https://github.com/kitsunetrail/kestrelynx/blob/ed7813edc159f5ea0b6a747bfebf78e45fa2ba23/experiments/runtime-discovery/procfs.go).

### What it reads

The collector obtains container host PIDs through the Docker API, then
reads the host's `/proc`. The main read operations are implemented in the
published version of [procfs.go](https://github.com/kitsunetrail/kestrelynx/blob/ed7813edc159f5ea0b6a747bfebf78e45fa2ba23/experiments/runtime-discovery/procfs.go).

| Function | Information read | Relevant permissions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `readExe` | The `exe` link target | Identifying the executable involves a ptrace read access check |
| `readMaps` | Executable file mappings in `maps` | Identifying loaded files involves a ptrace read access check |
| `socketInodesForPID` | Entries in `fd/` and socket inodes from their links | Both directory permissions and ptrace checks on the links apply |
| `readStatus` | The target process's effective UID and `CapEff` | Records the privileges of the observed process |

`socketInodesForPID` first lists `fd/`, then reads each link. With only
`CAP_SYS_PTRACE`, the measurement failed at the enumeration step. Package
use could still be confirmed through mappings, but the information needed
to attribute listening sockets to a PID was unavailable.

### How permission conditions and failures are recorded

The collector's `-permission` argument labels the condition in the
results. It does not grant privileges.[^harness]

| Label | Measurement condition |
| --- | --- |
| `root` | Run as root |
| `ptrace` | Run as non-root with `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` on the compiled executable |
| `ptrace_dac` | Run as non-root with `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` and `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` |
| `none` | Run as non-root without capabilities |

The permission comparison used a compiled executable, rather than
`go run`. The published [README](https://github.com/kitsunetrail/kestrelynx/blob/ed7813edc159f5ea0b6a747bfebf78e45fa2ba23/experiments/runtime-discovery/README.md) describes the environment,
build, collection, and matching procedures.

Failed operations are retained in the observations. After matching,
`permissions.csv` reports the operation, result, occurrence count, and
error message, among other fields. The output is implemented in
[match_report.go](https://github.com/kitsunetrail/kestrelynx/blob/ed7813edc159f5ea0b6a747bfebf78e45fa2ba23/experiments/runtime-discovery/match_report.go). This allows comparison of which
operations failed under each permission condition and how those failures
affected package-use confirmation.

## When access still fails

### Check both the file configuration and runtime privileges

`getcap` reports file capabilities, not the privileges of an already
running process.[^getcap] Compare it with `CapEff` in the reader's
`/proc/<pid>/status`. The collector's `readStatus` function records the
observed target's privileges, so check the collector's privileges separately. Running `cat /proc/self/status` reports information about `cat`;
use the specific PID when checking another process.[^status]

| Check | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Launcher's `NoNewPrivs` | A value of `1` prevents gaining new privileges through file capabilities |
| `nosuid` on the executable's mount | File capabilities are not applied at execution |
| Launcher's `CapBnd` | Limits capabilities obtainable at execution |
| Rebuilding or replacing the executable | File capabilities may not survive; check again |

Inspect the launcher's `/proc/<pid>/status` for `NoNewPrivs` and `CapBnd`.
Inspect mount options on the filesystem containing the collector's
executable. Execution restrictions can also cause startup
itself to fail with `Operation not permitted`, before any procfs
read.[^execve][^status]

Granting capabilities to a general-purpose interpreter such as a shell or
Python extends privileges to the programs it can execute. Limit capability grants to the collection executable and check its
ownership and write permissions.

### Check namespace visibility and host restrictions

A capability held inside a container does not necessarily authorize the
same operation on a host process. Check the relationship between the
reader's and target's user namespaces. PID namespaces also affect which
PIDs are visible: the target must exist in the reader's procfs
view.[^userns][^proc]

`hidepid` may restrict other users' process information, and AppArmor or
SELinux policies may deny access. Inspect procfs mount options and host
audit logs before adding capabilities.[^proc][^ptrace]

Record the path and operation for each failure. Distinguish permission
errors such as `EACCES` and `EPERM` from errors such as `ENOENT` caused by
a disappearing process or path. This helps determine whether additional
permissions would address the failure.

### Treat Docker API permissions separately

Reading host procfs and accessing the Docker API require separate
permissions. The measurement collector also uses the Docker API to obtain containers
and their PIDs.[^harness]

When the socket is used to obtain containers or PIDs from a conventional
rootful Docker Engine, access can itself permit root-level operations on
the host. A collector that sends only GET requests does not make its
socket access read-only.[^docker]
