# Interactive Guide to the procfs Package Mapping Workflow

Published: October 5, 2026

## Overview

- This eight-step diagram follows `libssl.so.3` loaded by a worker in the running `nginx` container, through `/proc` reads and the container’s dpkg records to a match with Trivy’s reported `libssl3` version `3.0.16-1~deb12u1` and a `confirmed` loading record
- It illustrates the process-to-package mapping and scan-matching workflow described in [How to Map Running Container Processes to OS Packages with procfs](procfs-process-to-package-mapping.md)
- The values are actual measurements from September 12, 2026, showing one worker from the `nginx` container started from the `nginx:1.27` image

Measurement results, exceptions, and limitations are explained in [How to Map Running Container Processes to OS Packages with procfs](procfs-process-to-package-mapping.md).
The [Interactive Guide to the bpftrace Measurement Workflow](bpftrace-event-observation-interactive.md) shows how recording events as they happen can capture short-lived activity that periodic reads can miss.
