//  2. Otherwise (the cgroup is still unclassified, or names a container
//     this session has never registered a generation for at all —
//     routePending): if this event's own mount namespace matches exactly
//     one currently-live generation's own already-confirmed mount view

//     ever claiming it as a provable loss the way tier 1 is — see
//     generationState.markCoveragePartial's own doc comment on why this
//     never advances eventsLost.
//  3. Neither: this event genuinely cannot be tied to anything this session
//     currently knows about. Counted via recordUnclassifiedEventLoss rather
//     than silently discarded, but never before a discovery pass that
//     started after this event's own receivedAt has actually completed
//     (ready reports false until then) — a container's own cgroup is very
//     often classified only once a discovery pass actually reseeds it (see

//     delivery cannot be relied on alone), so giving up before that pass has

//     even for an already-ended generation, and why this comparison never
//     rounds s_ns down to a clock tick the way an earlier version of this
//     function did. Also used for the zero-startBoottimeNs aggregate case.
//     The accompanying *generationState is non-nil.
//   - routeUnconfirmed: this event's own container ID has a known generation
//     (the *latest* one this session knows of for it) whose own start is not
//     later than s_ns, but no generation's own proven-alive window
//     (routeResolved's own condition) covers s_ns — this session has not yet
//     confirmed, via a live procfs read right now (not by trusting an
//     earlier one; see genconfirm.go), that this candidate's own init PID is
//     still actually alive at or after s_ns. The accompanying
//     *generationState is non-nil and names the candidate to confirm, not
//     (yet) a generation safe to attribute anything to.
//   - routeDiscard: cgroupID is confirmed to name no container evidence
//     should ever be attributed through at all (a host process's own
//     cgroup, or one belonging to an operator-excluded container ID) —
//     never queued, never counted as a loss.
//   - routeUnresolved: cgroupID names a real, non-excluded container this
//     session has registered at least one generation for, but none of them
//     could even be a candidate at all right now (s_ns is older than every
//     known generation's own start). Worth continuing to wait for (an
//     earlier generation than any currently known might still be
//     discovered); counted as an unattributable loss if pendingRouteEventTTL
//     passes first.
//   - routePending: cgroupID names a real, non-excluded container, but this
//     session has never registered even one generation for it at all — out
//     of this stage's own scope (see pendingRouteEvent's own doc comment on
//     why this is discarded, not counted, once its own TTL passes).
//   - routeGapLoss: s_ns can be proven to belong to no generation this
//     session knows about at all — either it falls strictly between two
//     known generations' own proof (an intermediate generation this session
//     never discovered at all could have parented it instead), or it falls
//     inside some candidate generation's own starttime tick without
//     independent proof that this event's own process is that generation's
//     own init itself (see this function's own doc comment on the
//     tick-boundary case). Already fully recorded (as a loss, downgrading
//     only this one container's own generations to partial) by
//     resolveEventGeneration itself before returning, the only place with
//     the exact bounding generations in hand; the caller does nothing
//     further with it. Never resolvable on a later retry, so a caller must
//     never re-queue it, and must never count it as a loss a second time

// resolveEventGeneration resolves cgroupID to the container ID it belongs

// (live or recently ended, within the 7-day retention window —
// endedRetention) this event's own process — identified only by its start
// nanosecond s_ns (startBoottimeNs itself, the raw boot-relative nanosecond
// bpf/kestrelynx.c's kl_exec_success/kl_mmap_success report via
// task_struct's start_boottime, never rounded to a clock tick) — can be
// *proven*, not guessed, to belong to.
//
// Exactly one generation is ever alive for a given container ID at a time
// (a same-ID restart always ends the old one first — see
// reconcileGenerations), so the proof this function relies on is: if some
// generation G's own init was confirmed alive (by an ordinary sample, or by
// genconfirm.go's own dedicated check) at some boot-relative nanosecond t,
// then it was certainly still alive at every earlier nanosecond back to its
// own start too — s_ns <= t is proof this exact process could have been
// (and, since only one generation is ever alive for this container ID at
// once, must have been) G's own. lastAliveNs holds the highest such t this
// session has ever confirmed for G (see that field's own doc comment);
// checking s_ns <= G.lastAliveNs is exactly this proof, entirely at
// nanosecond precision — an earlier version of this function instead
// rounded both sides down to a shared 10ms clock tick (bootNsToTicks) before
// comparing, which could not tell a confirmation and a process that started
// after it apart if both merely happened to round into the same tick (e.g.
// a confirmation at 10.001s and a post-restart process at 10.009s both
// floor to tick 1000) — and it applies equally to an already-ended G: ending
// does not un-confirm a fact this session already established while it was
// still alive.
//
// The lower bound — s_ns must not be older than G's own start — has the
// opposite precision problem: InitProcess.Starttime is only ever available
// in clock ticks at all (/proc/<pid>/stat has no finer unit), so the
// earliest G could possibly have started is ticksToNs(G.init.Starttime), a
// floor that may understate G's own real start by up to one whole tick. An
// s_ns that falls inside G's own starttime tick
// (ticksToNs(G.init.Starttime) <= s_ns < ticksToNs(G.init.Starttime+1)) is
// therefore never resolved to G by default, even when no other generation is
// in the picture at all: an earlier version of this function tried to prove
// the absence of an overlapping predecessor instead, by checking whether the
// generation immediately before G (for this same container ID) had its own
// lastAliveNs already short of that tick's own start — but a generation's
// lastAliveNs falling short of some instant is only the highest nanosecond
// this session happened to confirm it alive at, never proof it had actually
// ended by then; it could easily have kept running, uninterrupted and simply
// unconfirmed, right up to (or into) G's own starttime tick, without
// contradicting "only one generation is ever alive for a given container ID
// at a time" at all. That check is gone.
//
// The one exception this function still accepts inside G's own starttime
// tick is independent proof that this event's own process *is* G's own init
// itself, not merely some other process that happens to share that same
// 10ms window: the event's own TGID equals G.init.PID, and the event's own
// s_ns, floored to a clock tick, equals G.init.Starttime. Two distinct
// processes can never share both the same PID and the same starttime tick,
// so this is exact proof, independent of any other generation's own state —
// and it is the one thing that keeps a container's own main program from
// permanently registering as an unattributable loss purely because its own
// first exec/mmap necessarily lands in its own init's own starttime tick.
// Every other process that merely starts within that same 10ms window — a
// short-lived helper forked moments after the container's own init, say —
// is counted as a gap loss instead (see routeGapLoss): this is deliberately
// conservative, never guessed.
//
// If no known generation's own proof already covers s_ns, only one further
// possibility can still be resolved without guessing: s_ns might belong to
// the *latest* generation this session knows of for this container ID,
// sometime after the last instant that generation was actually confirmed
// alive — but only if s_ns is not older than that generation's own start
// tick. This is routeUnconfirmed: the caller must dispatch a live procfs
// check (genconfirm.go) before trusting it, since an unnoticed restart could
// have already superseded it.
//
// Critically, a *known, later* generation existing is never enough on its
// own to resolve an s_ns that falls before it and after every other known
// generation's own proof: it proves a restart happened at some point before
// that later generation's own start, but not that no *other*, still
// undiscovered generation existed in between (a container that restarted
// twice in quick succession between two of this session's own discovery
// passes, say). Such an s_ns can never be proven to belong to any generation
// this session knows about — see routeGapLoss.
//
// This is exact, boot-relative-only arithmetic; it deliberately never
// projects into wall-clock time to compare against a generation's own
// startedAt/endedAt. Those two fields are recorded only once a discovery
// pass actually notices the container — which can lag the container's own
// real start (and therefore this exact process's own real start) by up to
// one whole --interval — so filtering candidates by that wall-clock window
// instead would routinely, and incorrectly, reject the very generation this
// match exists to find.
//
// A zero startBoottimeNs (never expected from kl_exec_success/
// kl_mmap_success, which always set it, but not asserted here; used by
// reconcileEventLossCounters' own per-cgroup aggregate attribution, which
// has no single event to take a process start time from) skips this whole
// proof procedure, falling back to whichever generation for this container
// ID is currently live and returning it as routeResolved directly: an
// aggregate ring-buffer counter increase is already an approximate signal,
// not a specific process's own usage evidence, so the same precision this
// function otherwise insists on would buy nothing here.
// mntNSID is the event's own mount namespace ID, or 0 when the caller has no
// single event to take one from at all (reconcileEventLossCounters' own
// per-cgroup aggregate — see its own call site). A nonzero mntNSID equal to
// s.hostMntNSID (this observer's own host/PID-1 mount namespace, resolved
// once at startup — see Run's own doc comment) is routeDiscard, checked
// before even the cgroup lookup below: a real Docker container's own
// workload always execs inside a mount namespace that container's own
// creation already unshared away from the host's — see
// docker-compose.sensor.yml's own pid: host, which shares only the PID
// namespace, never the mount one — so an event reporting the host's own
// mount namespace can never be a container's own usage evidence, regardless
// of which cgroup it happens to carry. This is what a short-lived host-side
// helper process (runc/containerd's own namespace-setup stages, an
// unrelated system service, a `docker build` intermediate container's own
// toolchain churn — none of them ever becoming a cgroup this session's own
// cgroupRoute can classify as a tracked container, since none of them are
// one) would otherwise route through: routeUnresolved/routePending, queued,
// and — once its own pendingRouteEventTTL expires with the cgroup still
// unclassified — folded into every currently-tracked container's own
// events_coverage as an unattributable, global downgrade to partial, despite

//     already-confirmed generation is exactly as unprovably innocent of an
//     unattributed kernel-wide counter as one whose own view is still
//     unconfirmed.
//   - mntNSID != 0 (a specific event's own mount namespace is known):
//     every live generation whose own confirmed mount view
//     (generationState.mntNsID) matches mntNSID is downgraded, and every
//     live generation whose own mount view is not yet confirmed at all is

//     it, so not yet knowing rules nothing out. A confirmed generation
